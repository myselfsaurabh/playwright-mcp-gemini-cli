# HR Workflow Automation System - Interview Guide

## 🎯 Project Overview (30-second elevator pitch)

"I designed and implemented an end-to-end HR workflow automation system that uses AI agents and LangGraph to automate the entire hiring pipeline—from resume screening to interview scheduling and feedback processing. The system integrates with Workday, Microsoft Teams, and email to create a fully autonomous hiring workflow that reduced time-to-hire by 60% and improved candidate matching accuracy by 45%."

## 📋 Problem Statement (What problem did you solve?)

**Business Challenge:**
- Manual resume screening was taking 2-3 hours per requisition
- Hiring managers spent 40% of their time on administrative hiring tasks
- Scheduling interviews involved 15+ back-and-forth emails on average
- Candidate feedback was inconsistent and not properly documented in Workday
- Talent acquisition team was bottlenecked handling 50+ open requisitions simultaneously

**Technical Challenge:**
- Needed to orchestrate multiple AI agents with complex dependencies
- Required real-time integration with enterprise systems (Workday, Microsoft Graph API)
- Had to handle asynchronous, event-driven workflows across multiple systems
- Needed robust error handling and workflow state management
- Required semantic search across thousands of resumes with millisecond response times

---

## 🏗️ Architecture & System Design

### **1. High-Level Architecture**

**Multi-Agent Orchestration with LangGraph:**
- Built a stateful, event-driven workflow using LangGraph's StateGraph
- Five specialized agents working in orchestrated pipeline
- Each agent has specific responsibilities and communicates via shared state
- Implemented conditional branching based on agent outputs

**Technology Stack Decision Rationale:**
- **LangGraph**: Chosen for its superior state management and multi-agent orchestration capabilities over simple LangChain chains
- **Pinecone + Chroma**: Hybrid vector store approach—Pinecone for production (scalability), Chroma for local dev/testing
- **FastAPI**: Asynchronous request handling essential for long-running workflows
- **Docker**: Containerization for consistent deployment across environments
- **PostgreSQL**: For workflow audit logs, candidate history, and analytics

### **2. Agent Architecture (Detailed)**

#### **Resume Agent**
- **Responsibility**: Extract, process, and embed resumes from Workday
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - Pulls resumes via Workday REST API using OAuth 2.0 authentication
  - Uses RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter (chunk_size=1000, overlap=200) to segment long resumes
  - Generates embeddings using OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 (1536 dimensions)
  - Stores vectors in Pinecone with rich metadata (skills, experience, role, location)
  - Processes 100+ resumes in parallel using asyncio for performance
  
- **Key Technical Decisions**:
  - Chose chunking strategy to preserve context while fitting in embedding window
  - Implemented incremental processing (only new/updated resumes) to reduce API costs
  - Added deduplication logic based on candidate email hash

#### **Matching Agent**
- **Responsibility**: Semantic matching of candidates to job requisitions
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - Monitors Workday API for new requisitions (polling every 5 minutes via Celery task)
  - Uses LLM (GPT-4) to generate optimized search query from job description
  - Performs similarity search in Pinecone (cosine similarity, k=50 initial matches)
  - Implements two-stage ranking:
    - Stage 1: Vector similarity (fast, retrieves top 50)
    - Stage 2: LLM-based evaluation (GPT-4 scores each candidate with reasoning)
  - Combines scores: final_score = 0.7 × llm_score + 0.3 × vector_similarity
  - Shortlists top 10 candidates and emails hiring manager

- **Advanced Features**:
  - Implements query expansion using job title synonyms
  - Applies metadata filtering (years of experience, location, visa status)
  - Caches requisition embeddings to avoid redundant API calls

#### **Hiring Manager Agent**
- **Responsibility**: Parse hiring manager email responses
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - Connects to Outlook via IMAP (Office 365), checks inbox every 5 minutes
  - Uses GPT-4 with structured prompting to extract:
    - Selected candidate names/numbers
    - Additional interview requirements
    - Urgency level
  - Implements two-phase parsing:
    - Phase 1: LLM extracts structured JSON
    - Phase 2: Regex fallback if JSON parsing fails
  - Maps email threads to requisition IDs using subject line patterns

- **Edge Cases Handled**:
  - Ambiguous candidate references ("the first two", "John and Sarah")
  - Multi-language emails (automatic language detection)
  - Reply-to-reply chains (extracts only new content)

#### **Scheduler Agent**
- **Responsibility**: Coordinate interview scheduling between candidates and managers
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - Requests availability from candidates via email
  - Retrieves hiring manager calendar via Microsoft Graph API
  - Implements interval tree algorithm to find overlapping free slots
  - Creates Teams meetings using Graph API with automatic recording enabled
  - Sends calendar invitations to both parties
  
- **Scheduling Algorithm**:
  ```
  1. Get candidate availability windows (parsed from email response)
  2. Fetch manager's calendar for next 14 days
  3. Calculate manager's free slots (9 AM - 5 PM, excluding weekends)
  4. Find intersection of candidate availability and manager free time
  5. Prioritize slots: prefer mornings > afternoons, prefer earlier dates
  6. Book 1-hour slot, leaving 30-min buffer before/after existing meetings
  ```

- **Optimization**:
  - Batch processes multiple candidates to minimize API calls
  - Caches manager calendar for 15 minutes to reduce Graph API rate limiting
  - Implements exponential backoff for API failures

#### **Feedback Agent**
- **Responsibility**: Process post-interview feedback and update Workday
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - Monitors inbox for emails with "feedback" or "interview" keywords
  - Uses GPT-4 with structured output to extract:
    - Candidate name and role
    - Technical/cultural fit ratings (1-5 scale)
    - Hire/no-hire decision with reasoning
    - Strengths and concerns (bullet points)
  - Updates Workday candidate status via REST API
  - Triggers follow-up workflows (offer preparation, rejection letter, next round)

- **Data Quality Measures**:
  - Validates extracted data against known candidate list
  - Flags low-confidence extractions for human review
  - Maintains audit trail of all feedback in PostgreSQL

### **3. LangGraph Workflow Orchestration**

**State Management:**
- Defined comprehensive workflow state schema:
  ```
  State {
    workflow_id, requisition_id, status, current_step,
    selected_candidates[], scheduled_interviews[], 
    interview_feedback[], errors[], metadata{}
  }
  ```

**Workflow DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph):**
```
process_resumes → check_requisitions → match_candidates →
process_manager_response → schedule_interviews → 
process_feedback → finalize_workflow → END
```

**Conditional Routing:**
- After `check_requisitions`: if no new requisitions → skip to END
- After `process_manager_response`: if no candidates selected → notify and loop back
- After `schedule_interviews`: if scheduling fails → escalate to human

**Error Handling & Retries:**
- Each node wrapped in try-catch with exponential backoff
- Failed nodes log errors to state and continue workflow (degraded mode)
- Critical failures trigger notifications to Slack/PagerDuty
- Workflow can be resumed from last successful checkpoint

**State Persistence:**
- State snapshots saved to PostgreSQL after each node execution
- Enables workflow recovery after system crashes
- Supports long-running workflows (interviews span days/weeks)

### **4. Integration Layer**

#### **Workday Integration**
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 with refresh token rotation
- **API Operations**:
  - GET /candidates/resumes (batch retrieval)
  - GET /requisitions (filter by status=open)
  - PUT /candidates/{id}/status (update with feedback)
- **Rate Limiting**: 100 requests/minute, implemented token bucket algorithm
- **Error Handling**: Retry with exponential backoff on 429/500 errors

#### **Microsoft Graph API Integration**
- **Authentication**: MSAL library with client credentials flow
- **Scopes**: Calendars.ReadWrite, Mail.Send, OnlineMeetings.ReadWrite
- **API Operations**:
  - GET /users/{id}/calendar/calendarView (get busy times)
  - POST /users/{id}/events (create Teams meeting)
  - POST /users/{id}/sendMail (send notifications)
- **Optimization**: Batch requests where possible to reduce latency

#### **Email Integration**
- **Protocols**: IMAP (receiving), SMTP (sending)
- **Security**: TLS 1.3, app-specific passwords
- **Processing Pipeline**:
  - IMAP idle for real-time email notifications (vs polling)
  - Email content sanitization (remove signatures, disclaimers)
  - Attachment extraction and virus scanning (ClamAV)

### **5. Vector Database Strategy**

**Hybrid Approach:**
- **Pinecone (Primary)**: Production workload
  - Serverless, auto-scaling to handle spikes
  - Sub-100ms query latency at scale
  - Metadata filtering for complex queries
  
- **Chroma (Secondary)**: Development and backup
  - Local persistence, no external dependencies
  - Used for unit tests and local development
  - Fallback if Pinecone unavailable

**Indexing Strategy:**
- **Namespace design**: Separate namespaces for active/archived candidates
- **Metadata schema**:
  ```json
  {
    "candidate_id": "WD12345",
    "skills": ["Python", "AWS"],
    "experience_years": 8,
    "location": "San Francisco",
    "last_updated": "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z",
    "source": "workday"
  }
  ```
- **Refresh policy**: Re-embed candidates every 6 months to capture resume updates

**Query Optimization:**
- Implemented query result caching (Redis) for identical searches
- Pre-filtering using metadata before vector search (reduces search space by 70%)
- Used approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) for sub-second responses

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### **1. FastAPI Application Design**

**Architecture Pattern**: Clean Architecture with dependency injection

**Project Structure:**
```
├── agents/          # Business logic (5 agent classes)
├── workflows/       # LangGraph workflow definitions
├── integrations/    # External API clients (Workday, Teams, Email)
├── api/             # FastAPI routes and request/response models
├── config/          # Configuration management
└── tests/           # Unit and integration tests
```

**Key Endpoints:**

- Webhook callbacks for event-driven triggers (Workday → FastAPI)

### **2. Observability & Monitoring**

**Logging Stack:**
- **Loguru** for structured logging
- Logs include: workflow_id, agent_name, action, duration, error details
- Shipped to ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for centralized analysis

**Tracing:**
- **LangSmith** integration for LLM call tracing
  - Tracked token usage, latency, prompt/response pairs
  - Identified slow LLM calls (>3s) and optimized prompts
- **LangFuse** for production monitoring

### **3. Data Flow & State Management**

**Workflow Execution Flow:**
1. Trigger received (API call or Celery task)
2. Workflow ID generated, initial state created
3. State stored in PostgreSQL (workflow_executions table)
4. LangGraph invokes first node (Resume Agent)
5. Each node:
   - Reads state from shared memory
   - Executes business logic (calls agent)
   - Updates state with results
   - Persists state to DB
   - Returns updated state to graph
6. Graph transitions to next node based on edges
7. Final node generates summary and closes workflow

**State Synchronization:**
- Used PostgreSQL row-level locking to prevent concurrent updates
- Implemented optimistic locking with version numbers
- State checkpointing every 5 nodes to enable resume

### **4. Security & Compliance**

**Authentication & Authorization:**
- API secured with JWT tokens (OAuth 2.0)
- Service-to-service auth using API keys (rotated monthly)
- Role-based access control (RBAC): Admin, HR Manager, Read-Only

**Data Privacy:**
- PII data encrypted at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.3)
- Candidate data anonymized in logs (replaced with hashed IDs)
- GDPR compliance: candidate data retention policy (auto-delete after 2 years)

**Secrets Management:**
- Used AWS Secrets Manager for API keys and credentials
- Environment-specific secrets (dev, staging, prod)
- Automated secret rotation every 90 days

**Audit Logging:**
- Every data access logged with user, timestamp, operation
- Immutable audit log stored in append-only S3 bucket
- Quarterly security audits and penetration testing

### **5. Performance Optimization**

**Latency Improvements:**
- Reduced resume processing from 5s → 1.2s per resume:

**Cost Optimization:**
- Reduced OpenAI API costs by 40%:
  - Prompt engineering (reduced avg tokens from 800 → 450)
  - Result caching (Redis TTL: 1 hour for identical queries)
  - Switched to GPT-3.5-turbo for 70% of operations

**Database Optimization:**

## 🚧 Challenges & Solutions

### **Challenge 1: LLM Hallucination in Email Parsing**

**Problem:** 
- GPT-4 occasionally invented candidate names or ratings that weren't in the email
- Caused downstream issues in Workday updates (updating wrong candidate)

**Solution:**
- Implemented two-phase validation:
  1. LLM extraction with structured output (JSON schema)
  2. Validation layer: cross-reference extracted names with known candidate list
- Added confidence scores: if confidence <0.8, flag for human review
- Reduced hallucination rate from 8% → 0.3%

### **Challenge 2: Rate Limiting from Workday API**

**Problem:**
- Workday API limited to 100 requests/minute
- Burst processing of 200+ resumes triggered rate limits
- Caused workflow failures and delays

**Solution:**
- Implemented token bucket algorithm for rate limiting
- Added request queuing with priority (new requisitions > resume updates)
- Cached frequently accessed data (requisition details, candidate metadata)
- Reduced API calls by 65% through batching and caching

### **Challenge 3: Calendar Scheduling Conflicts**

**Problem:**
- Race conditions when multiple workflows tried to book same time slot
- Led to double-bookings and angry hiring managers

**Solution:**
- Implemented distributed locking using Redis
- Lock acquisition before booking: key=`calendar:{manager_email}:{date}`
- Lock held for 60 seconds during booking operation
- Retry logic with exponential backoff if lock unavailable
- Eliminated double-bookings completely

### **Challenge 4: Handling Long-Running Workflows**

**Problem:**
- Workflows could span 2-3 weeks (interviews, feedback collection)
- System restarts or deployments interrupted in-progress workflows
- Lost state caused incomplete workflows

**Solution:**
- Implemented workflow checkpointing: state saved to PostgreSQL after each agent
- Built workflow recovery mechanism: on startup, resume from last checkpoint
- Added health checks: detect stalled workflows (no updates >48 hours), auto-retry
- Recovery success rate: 98%

### **Challenge 5: Email Noise & Spam Filtering**

**Problem:**
- System processed all emails, including newsletters, spam, out-of-office replies
- Caused false triggers and wasted LLM API calls

**Solution:**
- Pre-filtering pipeline:
  1. Subject line keywords ("interview", "candidate", "feedback", requisition IDs)
  2. Sender validation (whitelist of hiring manager domains)
  3. Content length threshold (>50 chars to filter "thanks" replies)
- Implemented spam classifier (fine-tuned BERT model)
- Reduced irrelevant email processing from 40% → 2%

## 🎤 Interview Talking Points

### **When asked: "Walk me through your project"**

"I built an end-to-end HR automation system that orchestrates five specialized AI agents using LangGraph. The system starts by embedding resumes from Workday into a vector database. When a new job requisition appears, the matching agent performs semantic search to find top candidates, which are emailed to the hiring manager. The hiring manager agent parses their response, the scheduler agent coordinates interviews via Teams, and finally the feedback agent processes post-interview feedback and updates Workday. The entire workflow is event-driven, handling failures gracefully, and has reduced time-to-hire by 60% while processing 2,400+ workflows."

### **When asked: "What was the biggest technical challenge?"**

"The biggest challenge was managing state across long-running, asynchronous workflows that could span weeks. Interviews don't happen immediately—there's back-and-forth with candidates, rescheduling, etc. I solved this by implementing comprehensive state checkpointing in PostgreSQL after each agent execution. Combined with LangGraph's built-in state management and a workflow recovery mechanism, we achieved 98% recovery success rate even after system restarts. This required careful design of the state schema and implementing idempotent operations to handle retries safely."

### **When asked: "How did you handle LLM reliability issues?"**

"LLMs can hallucinate, so I implemented multi-layered validation. For email parsing, I use GPT-4 with structured output constraints (JSON schema), then validate extracted data against known candidates. If confidence is below 0.8 or data fails validation, it's flagged for human review. I also added fallback regex parsers for simple cases. For candidate matching, I combine vector similarity with LLM-based evaluation, so even if the LLM makes a mistake, the vector search provides a safety net. This hybrid approach reduced errors from 8% to under 0.5%."

### **When asked: "How did you ensure scalability?"**

"I designed for horizontal scalability from day one. The FastAPI application runs as stateless containers in Kubernetes, so we can scale workers independently. The workflow orchestration is handled by Celery distributed task queue with Redis as the broker. For data layer, Pinecone auto-scales for vector search, and we use PostgreSQL with read replicas for state storage. The system currently handles 150+ concurrent workflows, and we've load-tested up to 500 with minimal latency degradation. The architecture could scale to 10,000+ requisitions per month with additional resources."

### **When asked: "What would you do differently?"**

"Looking back, I would have implemented more comprehensive integration testing earlier. We had good unit test coverage, but integration issues between agents only surfaced in staging. I'd also invest in a proper event-driven architecture using Kafka instead of polling APIs—it would reduce latency and system load. Finally, I'd build a more sophisticated prompt versioning system, since we iterated on prompts frequently and tracking changes in Git was suboptimal. A proper prompt management tool like LangSmith's prompt hub would have helped."
