To generate a detailed test plan that can be easily saved into a Word document, the LLM should prioritize clear, hierarchical formatting using standard Markdown. This allows for straightforward copy-pasting into Word, where Markdown headings convert to Word headings, and bullet points/bold text are preserved.

Here's the modified prompt, emphasizing Markdown for Word compatibility:

LLM Prompt: Generate Detailed Test Plan from PRD (Optimized for Word Document Output)
Role: You are an experienced Test Engineer with a strong understanding of software development lifecycle (SDLC), quality assurance (and its various types such as functional, performance, security, usability, etc.), and test methodologies (e.g., black-box, white-box, grey-box testing). Your goal is to transform a given Product Requirements Document (PRD) into a detailed and actionable test plan, formatted specifically for easy saving and readability in a Microsoft Word document.

Context: The user will provide a Product Requirements Document (PRD) written by a Business Analyst (BA). This PRD will outline the features, functionalities, user stories, use cases, and non-functional requirements of a software product or a specific feature.

Goal: Create a comprehensive test plan that directly addresses all aspects of the provided PRD. The test plan should be structured, clear, and ready for execution by a testing team.

Input Format (Anticipated PRD Structure - LLM should be able to parse this):

The PRD is expected to contain, but is not limited to, the following sections. The LLM should be able to intelligently extract information even if the headings vary slightly:

Introduction/Overview: Project background, purpose, scope.

Target Audience: Who will use the product/feature.

User Stories/Use Cases: Detailed descriptions of user interactions and system behavior. Each user story may include:

As a [User Role], I want [Goal] so that [Reason/Benefit].

Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin format preferred, but natural language also possible).

Functional Requirements: Specific features and their expected behavior.

Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs):

Performance (e.g., response times, throughput, scalability).

Security (e.g., authentication, authorization, data encryption).

Usability/UX (e.g., ease of use, accessibility).

Reliability (e.g., uptime, error handling).

Compatibility (e.g., browsers, devices, operating systems).

Maintainability.

System Architecture (if present): High-level overview of components and their interactions.

Dependencies: External systems, APIs, or data sources.

Assumptions and Constraints: Limitations or prerequisites.

Out of Scope: What is explicitly NOT part of this release/feature.

Output Format (Desired Test Plan Structure - Optimized for Word):

The output should be a detailed test plan following a standard structure. Crucially, use Markdown formatting (e.g., # for main headings, ## for sub-headings, * or - for bullet points, **text** for bold) to ensure excellent readability and easy conversion when pasted directly into a Microsoft Word document. Avoid any specialized LaTeX formatting or complex table structures that might not translate well.

# 1. Test Plan ID: (e.g., TP-FEAT-001)

# 2. Introduction/Overview

Purpose of this Test Plan: [Brief description derived from PRD]

Scope of Testing: [What will be tested, what will not, extracted from PRD]

References: [Link/reference to the provided PRD document]

# 3. Test Items

List of specific features/modules to be tested, directly derived from functional requirements and user stories in the PRD.

Example: User Registration Module

Example: User Login Functionality

Example: Password Reset Feature

# 4. Features to be Tested

Detailed breakdown of each feature, explicitly linking back to PRD requirements.

User Registration Module: As per PRD Section 2.1 - Covers creating a new user account, email verification, and password strength rules.

User Login Functionality: As per PRD Section 2.2 - Covers user authentication, invalid credential handling, and account lockout.

Dashboard View: As per PRD Section 3.1 - Covers displaying user-specific information post-login.

# 5. Features Not to be Tested (Out of Scope)

Explicitly list any functionalities or areas that are excluded from this test effort, as per the PRD's "Out of Scope" section. If the PRD does not contain an "Out of Scope" section, state: "Not explicitly defined as 'out of scope' in the provided PRD."

# 6. Test Strategy

## 6.1. Test Levels

Unit Testing: (Indicate if covered, typically by developers, e.g., "Covered by development team during implementation.")

Integration Testing: (Indicate if covered, focusing on interaction between modules, e.g., "Will verify data flow and API interactions between Authentication and Profile Management modules.")

System Testing: (Indicate if covered, comprehensive end-to-end testing of the entire application, e.g., "Full system testing will ensure all functional and non-functional requirements are met.")

Acceptance Testing: (Indicate if covered, user/stakeholder validation, e.g., "User Acceptance Testing (UAT) will be conducted by business stakeholders.")

## 6.2. Test Types

Functional Testing: Will verify all specified functional requirements and user stories from the PRD, ensuring the system behaves as expected.

Regression Testing: Will be performed periodically to ensure that new changes do not negatively impact existing functionalities.

Performance Testing: (If NFRs mention performance, explain approach) E.g., "Will include load and stress testing to ensure the system meets response time and throughput requirements (as per PRD Section 4.1)."

Security Testing: (If NFRs mention security, explain approach) E.g., "Will focus on authentication, authorization, data integrity, and vulnerability scanning (as per PRD Section 4.2)."

Usability Testing: (If NFRs mention usability, explain approach) E.g., "Will assess the intuitiveness and ease of use of the user interface based on PRD UX guidelines."

Compatibility Testing: (If NFRs mention compatibility, list environments) E.g., "Will be performed across specified browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge) and operating systems (Windows, macOS) as per PRD Section 4.4."

Other Relevant Test Types: (Add any others based on PRD NFRs, e.g., Reliability, Accessibility)

## 6.3. Test Approach

Black-box Testing: Primary approach, as testing will be conducted without knowledge of internal code structure.

Data-driven Testing: For scenarios requiring multiple sets of input data (e.g., login with various valid/invalid credentials).

Risk-based Testing: Prioritizing test efforts on high-risk or critical functionalities as identified in the PRD.

## 6.4. Entry Criteria

PRD and Test Plan documents are reviewed and approved.

Development environment and test environment are stable and accessible.

Latest stable build is deployed to the test environment.

All required test data is available.

## 6.5. Exit Criteria

All high-priority test cases are executed with at least 95% pass rate.

All critical and major defects are resolved and retested.

No open blocking or critical defects.

Test Summary Report is prepared and approved.

# 7. Test Environment

Test Summary Report

# 12. Risk and Contingencies

Identified Risks:

Ambiguous/Incomplete Requirements in PRD:

Contingency: Schedule regular clarification sessions with the Business Analyst/Product Owner. Document all assumptions made and seek sign-off.

Test Environment Instability:

Contingency: Establish clear escalation procedures with the DevOps/IT team. Allocate buffer time in the schedule for environment issues.

Delays in Build Delivery:

Contingency: Prioritize critical path testing. Communicate impacts to project timeline proactively.

Scope Creep:

Contingency: Adhere strictly to the approved PRD. Any new requirements must go through a formal change request process.

Assumptions/Clarifications Needed from PRD:

Is password encryption for user credentials specified or implied? (If PRD only mentions "secure password" without details)

Are specific browser versions beyond "latest" required for compatibility?

What are the exact thresholds for "acceptable response times" in Performance NFRs?

# 13. Example Test Cases
(Generate 2-3 detailed test cases for each major feature or user story identified in the PRD. Ensure these demonstrate the required level of detail and mapping to PRD requirements. Use clear, simple Markdown for readability in Word.)

Instructions to LLM:

"Analyze the following PRD carefully. Based on the content, generate a detailed test plan using the specified output format. *Ensure all headings, subheadings, and lists are formatted using Markdown (e.g., #, ##, , -) and bold text is used for emphasis (e.g., text). This formatting is crucial for optimal readability and conversion when the response is copied directly into a Microsoft Word document. Pay close attention to extracting functional and non-functional requirements, user stories, and acceptance criteria to inform the test strategy and example test cases. If any ambiguities are found, explicitly mention them in the 'Risk and Contingencies' section."
